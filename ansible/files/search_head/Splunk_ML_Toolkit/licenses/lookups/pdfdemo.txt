1. Objective:
Random dataset generated from scipy.stats exponential distribution and two overlapping normal distributions which sums into a gaussian kde distribution.
Designed to show the capabilities of DensityFunction to assign the correct density function to each population of the by field groups.

2. License: Splunk Owned

5. Field Meanings:
   1. city: Name of the city of times pregnant
   2. measurement: Random number from a density function (exponential or gaussian_kde)

6. Parameter Selection:
  A. Dashboard: Detect Outlier values
     Settings:
    1) Search: | inputlookup pdfdemo.csv | fit DensityFunction measurement by city into mymodel
    2) Field to fit: measurement
    3) By fields to fit: city
    4) Output field: IsOutlier(measurement)
